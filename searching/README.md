# Searching Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various searching algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

### Binary Search
- **File**: `binary_search.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) iterative, O(log n) recursive
- **Description**: Efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Linear Search
- **File**: `linear_search.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Description**: Simple algorithm that checks every element sequentially until the target is found.

## Usage

Run any algorithm file directly:
```bash
python binary_search.py
python linear_search.py
```
