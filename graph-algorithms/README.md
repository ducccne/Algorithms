# Graph Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms.

## Algorithms Included

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **File**: `bfs.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Description**: Traverses graph level by level using a queue. Also includes shortest path implementation.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **File**: `dfs.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
- **Description**: Traverses graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch. Includes both recursive and iterative implementations.

## Usage

Run any algorithm file directly:
```bash
python bfs.py
python dfs.py
```
