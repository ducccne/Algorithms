# Greedy Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of problems solved using greedy algorithm techniques.

## Problems Included

### Coin Change (Greedy)
- **File**: `coin_change.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Description**: Finds minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount. Note: Greedy approach works optimally only for canonical coin systems.

## Usage

Run any file directly to see examples:
```bash
python coin_change.py
```
