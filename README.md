# Algorithms

A collection of algorithm implementations and data structures for learning and reference purposes.

## 📚 Contents

This repository is organized into the following categories:

### 1. Sorting Algorithms (`sorting/`)
- **Bubble Sort** - Simple comparison-based sorting
- **Quick Sort** - Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting
- **Merge Sort** - Stable divide-and-conquer sorting

### 2. Searching Algorithms (`searching/`)
- **Binary Search** - Efficient search in sorted arrays
- **Linear Search** - Sequential search through elements

### 3. Data Structures (`data-structures/`)
- **Stack** - LIFO data structure
- **Queue** - FIFO data structure
- **Linked List** - Dynamic linear data structure

### 4. Graph Algorithms (`graph-algorithms/`)
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Level-order graph traversal
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Deep exploration graph traversal

### 5. Dynamic Programming (`dynamic-programming/`)
- **Fibonacci Numbers** - Multiple approaches (recursive, memoization, tabulation)

### 6. Greedy Algorithms (`greedy-algorithms/`)
- **Coin Change** - Minimum coins needed for a given amount

## 🚀 Getting Started

All implementations are written in Python and can be run directly:

```bash
# Example: Run a sorting algorithm
python sorting/bubble_sort.py

# Example: Run a graph algorithm
python graph-algorithms/bfs.py

# Example: Run a data structure
python data-structures/stack.py
```

## 📖 Usage

Each algorithm file contains:
- Detailed documentation and complexity analysis
- Clean, readable implementation
- Example usage in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block

Each directory also contains a README.md with more details about the algorithms in that category.

## 🧪 Testing

You can test any algorithm by running its file directly. The example usage at the bottom of each file demonstrates how to use the implementation.

## 📝 Contributing
